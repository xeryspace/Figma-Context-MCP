# MCP Integration Notes

This crawl uses the repository's built-in `get_figma_data` pipeline:

- Depth: 20
- File key: TLO9Ja4fcaUF6Uvt4AE0gK
- Root node: 462:164746
- Auth: Personal access token

Ensure `FIGMA_API_KEY` or `FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set before running:

```
FIGMA_API_KEY=your-figma-token
# or
FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN=your-oauth-token
```

Assets downloaded automatically into `462-164746/assets`.

Run again with the same command if you need to refresh the data.
